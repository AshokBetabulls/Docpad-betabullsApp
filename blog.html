                                                    <p>Five hundred miles of road trip, thirty-six consecutive hours with nothing but coding, coding, coding, seven hundred program-aholics and unlimited pizzas, sandwiches and soft drinks…… it is like I can never find an experience that would beat this one. Held by University of Maryland, United States, Bitcamp is a Hackathon sponsored by more than 30 influential IT companies including Microsoft, Bloomberg, Intel and AT&amp;T. As one of the 600+“Bitcampers”, I found Bitcamp a journey that was truly rewarding and enjoyable.</p>
<p>One of the many Hackathons supported by Major League Hacking(MLH), Bitcamp encourages its participants to “take what you love, fuse it with tech, build something the world has never seen.” Science and technology are no strangers to the hackers here: whenever an idea comes out, hackers dive into it and apply every technique possible to carry these ideas out. Nothing is ”too crazy” here – in fact, crazy ideas, once made into reality by hackers, are the ones that create so many “wow” moments in the expo time, the official displaying time following 36 consecutive working hours. “Iron Man” system is built based on Oculus 3D headsets, allowing you to have an Iron Man experience within the stadium; a team of McGill Engineering students created a software which allows user to dictate, instead of painstakingly type, math, physics and chemistry formula with just a microphone; there was even a musician-programmer team who designed a chord matcher that provides instant accompaniment for improvisational music!</p>
<p>What makes this event even more amazing is that you don’t have to know the language, platform or API that you are going to use in the Hackathon, as Hackathon is not just a place to apply your previous knowledge but also where you can learn a great bunch. One reason is that Hackathons require you to clear your mind and leave it with noting but programming for a long time. As the word “Hackathon” – which is composed of “hack” and “marathon” – suggests, Bitcamp really means some solid time commitment: hacking begins at 9 p.m. Friday, then goes all the way to 9 a.m. Sunday, with only air mattresses available for occasional naps. (Sounds not too cozy? In HackPrinceton they made us sleep in school buses…) Exhausting it might be, this unusual level of time commitment does grant huge chances of learning. (Or rather should I say you are forced to learn in order to carry out your project before the deadline?).</p>
<p>From a personal perspective, Bitcamp is my second Hackathon, following HackPrinceton which took place just one week before my trip to U of Maryland. Frankly, I have never expected much from any Hackathon experience, since I’m just a first-year university student in Computer Science and am in no way experienced in programming. However, Hackathons always turn out to teach, show, or even enable me to do things that I have had the slightest idea of before actually going. In Bitcamp, I played around with Raspberry Pi, a micro computer model based on Linux platform and tried to connect its ports to my own laptop so I can control every hardware attached to my laptop using Pi. Admittedly the result is not satisfactory – I did not successfully implant my program into Linux system of Pi, but that was the very beginning of my learning about Linux system. Most importantly, it drove my fear of learning Linux away, killed my procrastination in an instant, and once a hacker starts to learn something new and finds it cool – as you can imagine, a brand new world is once again out there for him.</p>

                                                    <p>Think back when man first ventured into space. Early missions were rockets, which evolved into satellites, then animals, humans and eventually a full space station. When a skyscraper is to be built, a small scale model is built first. When a programmer codes something new, they also code a test to ensure the code’s integrity. It is the natural course of things to first be tested before being built to scale. It is natural also to be creative and think beyond miniature scales. It’s awesome to be visionary and to dream without limits, but to bring these ideas to life, a structure and process must be applied. A foundational piece of that initial process is prototype testing.</p>
<p>“Measure twice, cut once.”<br>
Things look different from different perspectives. What might make 100% sense in your mind might not make sense to someone else. This doesn’t mean that if someone tells you your idea won’t work that you stop there. Think of the Wright Brothers. They were called “bluffers” for claiming they’d get a manned craft in the air. They started small, building prototype after prototype with only spruce wood, muslin fabric and modified bicycles. They tested their idea again and again, failure after failure, despite the critics. The Wright Brothers are a perfect example of taking small steps towards progress. They took things that already existed, working off previous knowledge of things they they’d already seen and experienced. They pieced together a prototype that would one day take to the sky and change our world forever.</p>
<p>Small steps build atop the last.<br>
If you wanted to become a handyman/contractor, would you start off by building a three story house? If you were just starting to learn how to code would you code the security system for an online bank? Even if you went to school to become a contractor or a computer programmer, got your degree and then got a job doing it, they’d start you off in an entry position because no amount of academic knowledge can prepare you for the real world experiences you’ll engage with your team and your customers. You’re embarking on a completely unique startup experience, that only you will ever live from your perspective. It’s a wildly exciting, liberating, and creative experience but to give yourself a chance to succeed, the wisdom of taking small steps and packing lite on your entrepreneur’s journey will make the trip much less stressful, more enjoyable and cost much much less!</p>
<p>Save some poker chips.<br>
There is no demand from a startup that you bet all your, and any other investor’s poker chips on the first hand. It’s still a stone cold hard killing fact that 90% or so of startups fail so you don’t want to go all in on your first hand if you don’t have to. Like the paragraph above said, if this is your first startup especially, your now then in your entry level startup position. You’re a entry level entrepreneur, no offense, because we’re here to help. We all started as entry level and had our failures just like the Wright Brothers. We were told things didn’t make sense or were bad ideas like the Wrights Bros and we were rejected hard sometimes like them as well. We all had our own paths to get here. Mine was mainly via MDM, which was 7 years in the trenches of small business NJ, working for nothing, trying to over-deliver to the wrong audience, getting sued, projects spanning months that were supposed to take weeks, clients bailing on invoices. Fun stuff, but it got me tough and now a few more startups later, I’m battle tested, stone hardened and ready to tell you my stories and lend you some of the wisdom that I have in concert with our other great mentors who have similar war stories of being a entry level entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Go forth and prosper.<br>
I’m surely not the first one to write on this subject. There have been countless before me. The message I want to instill in you in this blog post is to travel lite and follow your gut. If you have an idea and want to try it out, despite all the critics, then do it, but do it lite first. When you go backpacking, don’t carry over 50 lbs if you can. Don’t end up hurting your back trying to carry excess. Packing less makes the hike even fun. So hike hard my fellow entrepreneurs. We live in a great time to bring your ideas to life. There are so many things out there to help you and your idea succeed and we’re hoping that we get to be a help, mentor and guide on your journey.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Michael Duane Mooring</p>

                                                    <p><sub class="mute">Authored originally as a dialog to be given at a closing HackPSU workshop.</sub></p>
<p>I’m going to talk about the keystone of the Lean Startup Method, the build measure, learn loop. Who here’s heard of the book “The Lean Startup”? Who’s read it already? The core concept of the book, the method and the movement is to approach your startup properly as a scientific endeavor. Your hypothesis, in a very simple way of stating it, is that your solution/product that you’ve built or plan to build will be bought and used by people.</p>
<p>We’ll who are those people exactly? Maybe you know exactly your target market but that doesn’t guarantee success alone either. The core-concept of the Lean Startup really is just to get your product (or any form of it that you can muster) in-front of what you hypothesize as your target audience, ASAP to start collecting feedback. This can be done many different, simple and cost-effective ways, a smoke-test, concierge experience or MVP to name a few. A smoke test is simply throwing up some a focused marketing message in a focused strategic channel to gauge response. For example StartupWeekend did a smoke-test just a couple days ago on April 1st to see how many people would sign up their email to a <a href="http://eatcoderaverepeat.launchrock.com/" target="_blank">HolyShip!+StartupWeekend</a> on a launchrock landing page website. They got a couple hundred signups, which starts to validate the idea and gives them some good feedback data as readers thought they were really signing up for a HolyShip!+StartupWeekend.</p>
<p>Concierge is when you have a product or solution, but you start only with a handful of paying customers. These customers get the “concierge’s treatment”, where the founders are manually acting in place of their application. The example in the book is of a startup that did shopping, recipe making and deal finding for local moms. It’s now a thriving national business.</p>
<p>MVP stands for minimum viable product and it’s really what you guys hacked together this weekend. These apps, if they can make it through a user-flow without exploding, that’s a proper MVP by Eric Ries’ definition in his book, The Lean Startup. Doesn’t have to be anything fancy. Cool thing about testing your startup hypothesis with a MVP is that you can collect, real true honest behavioral data with how users interface with your app. Similar to a website’s analytics, you can see what pages users “bounce” or leave the app, what parts of the app are getting the most usage and if people really want to like your app, they might even leave some feedback that may sound negative or like a complaint, but when you’re starting up, users taking the time to give any sort of feedback is worlds better than crickets.</p>
<p>You can also go about collecting feedback from just an idea or some mockups, but this is the least ideal form of feedback and I’ll explain why now. I was at demo day for StartupWeekend New Jersey last Sunday and one team was presenting to the judges. They presented the fact that they’d been going out and asking people in person what they thought of the app concept. They said that 100% of everyone they talked to said it was a good app idea. I’m pretty sure they didn’t collect the emails of these people and I’m for sure that they didn’t collect any money from them.</p>
<p>See, it’s one thing to ask someone, point blank, in their face, some random person on the street, if they think your app idea or design mockup looks good, versus them actually using it by themselves when your not over their shoulder or better yet providing their email or best collecting a advanced payment for the product. Asking someone if you have a nice app idea is like asking if you look fat in the dress you’re wearing. 100% Everyone’s going to tell you that “you look great honey, keep rockin it!”. This kind of feedback is less than a paper weight. I mentioned doing this street survey but collecting emails which is better than nothing and every now and then someone will give you slightly better feedback than “oh yeah I’d use that for sure”. I also mentioned going so far as to swiping someone credit-card on Square to collect an advance payment. For that to work you’d need some pretty solid presentation, but if so, this is the strongest signal of feedback. I’m using the context of roaming the streets asking to swipe people credit cards for your startup concept, but this is far from ideal and can come off as sketchy. Really street surveys are best if they’re at an event where your target audience is present. Targeting user segments online and charging $5 for your MVP is a much more practical and common scenario, but what I’m really getting at is the different types of feedback you can collect from people.</p>
<p>Why collect this feedback at all? Because, as entrepreneur’s we face together the stone cold hard killing fact that still 9 out of 10 startup businesses fail. But if we can be customer-based and collect good feedback early in our startup we can have the leverage to decide on preforming what’s called a “pivot” into a product that customers actually want. Another important point to note is that customers can’t usually plainly articulate what they want exactly and this is where we come in to methodically build and test our product hypothesis’ with them to pivot into something that speaks for itself with customer referred, repeat sales, showing tracking and moving closer to what’s known as “product/market fit”. Also important to note here that the “just do it” mentality in startups can tend to miss this crucial step of feedback data collection, analysis &amp; reflection. The “just get it done” culture in many startups leaves them without any metrics from which they can reflect and then leverage towards an educated pivot or preserver decision.</p>
<p>I’m going to wrap up with a few resources and next steps. Startup Hack Weekends like this are one of the most fun things I’ve personally done before, but I’m a startup nerd, point being that when you’re in this environment, you jump right into executing your awesome ideas with usually not any time to do a more thorough competitor search. There is the phrase “There’s nothing new under the Sun.” Luckily this isn’t actually true. We all made new creations this weekend even if they end up being another take or iteration on an existing competitor’s product, but do not let this discourage you from starting your venture in the slightest. Even if you find someone doing the exact same thing in the exact same way for the exact same market, what you’ve built this weekend lends itself to being an open-source product or offering, which if your competitor doesn’t have a patent, this can be really effective and disruptive way to enter the same market if done with poise. Also as you look to the left and your right and all around, you’ll see there truly is no shortage of awesome product ideas to be had so if you’re not confident in your product taking on a competitors, then bring on the ideas. One competitive advantage any student of the Lean Startup Method has is being armed with the process to systematically out-learn competitors and pivot, grow and evolve into a superior offer than a competitor’s. And what I’m getting at with all that is that a usual first step in starting a business is research.</p>
<p>I’ll close with the resource that is the Lean Method’s version of the business plan, The Lean Canvas. Iterated from the Business Model Canvas, the Lean Canvas was a creation of Ash, author of “Running Lean”. The idea behind the Lean Canvas is that your entire business and organization IS the product and you define your business model on a single page divided into rectangle areas. The idea is that they are quick and you do more than one for the same startup or product idea, based off a concept called “ideation” in graphic/UI design where a designer out of wisdom creates three or so different mockups of the same knowing that if he or she designed just one, they’d fall in love with it as their baby and have nothing against it. This way the designer has three babies too choose from and can more easily see the differences. The Lean Canvas is ideation of your business model in the process of iterating towards a superior business definition. Closing on the visual of our organization as the product, think on Charlie and his Chocolate factory. Not only were the chocolate bars world class as standalone products on the store shelves, but they were born in an entire factory that matched their spirit and culture throughout every square foot of Charlie’s Factory. When someone downloads your app, they aren’t just getting the candy bar from the shelf, they are through that interaction, indirectly engaging the internals of your organization. They are experiencing the result of every hand that went into delivering that version. Considering Charlie’s Chocolate Factory and then contrasting with Google’s or Apple’s offices, we see the similarities. How that fun, awesome, sleek work environment and culture translates into products that are also fun, clean, sleek and awesome. Best of luck to all of you. Cheers!</p>
<p><u>Sincerely</u>,<br>

                                                    <p>Despite well intentioned first time entrepreneur’s thoughts, code is not lego blocks. Code is still computer science in college course titles, no one thought to change it to computational blocks yet.</p>
<p>Yes frameworks, the amount of people coding and superset languages have made things easier to get a prototype online, but it’s still code. They are still “languages” and there are multiple languages used in getting your idea online. If you were a contractor, already experienced and building houses and someone came to you and said to you “Hey I’ve got this great property by the ocean. You build a house there for me and when it sells, I’ll give you 10%!” Sounds… bad.</p>
<p>And this is how it sounds when you are looking for a developer for your startup: “Hey I’ve got this great app idea. You code it for me and I’ll give you 10%.” Maybe, if it ever turns into anything, but you’re up against 9/10 odds for your businesses success. The point is, when you break it down to that simple form, it’s weak. It’s a bad deal on the developer’s side. Sure there are more developers now than ever but there are still not enough. This is why Mark Zuckerberg has teamed with Bill Gates and others to make Code.org, because they (Mark &amp; Bill) don’t have enough coders for their own growing businesses (Facebook &amp; Microsoft) in a growing industry.</p>
<p>There are countless IT recruitment businesses. I can’t believe so many are in business it’s boggling to me. They are aggressive. They find talent and have them in their client’s office in a week or two and these jobs pay really well. If you want to find a quality developer off the streets to sit at your house and code for you, you’re facing some steep competition and money.</p>
<p>Back in the 90s, to have your own business was a very serious thing. The stigma back then was that you needed to go in with a hundred thousand or two and have all your ducks in a nice need row before you had any chance of maybe succeeding. Now the stigma has and is changing in our ever technologically advancing world towards anyone with an app idea feeling entitled to have that chance at becoming a iApp millionaire. Hopefully, younger developers and entrepreneurs won’t look back on this article in the near future (next 3 years maybe), when developing software for machines &amp; devices is literally as simple/intuitive as stacking lego blocks and think that I was just a bitter old man, mouthing off in his own little blog post. I hope instead it reflects how I’m feeling in the present, just before lego block coding but facing an oncoming sea of startup ideas and the stigma that each is great and deserves a developer to code their idea.</p>
<p>I hope this article wasn’t too harsh. The good news we have a system in place here at BetaBulls to get your app idea online. We are lucky enough to already have a sturdy team of developers to bring your idea to life. We’re an idea factory. We make apps all day. If you’re set on finding a lone developer for your startup, then please, don’t be discouraged by my writing above. They are out there and there are more and more everyday, but if you look and look and look and simply can’t find, remember that we’ll still be here waiting and ready to upstart your awesome app idea.</p>
